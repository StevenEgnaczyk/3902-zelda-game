# Sprint 5 Reflection
As there are no other sprints after this one, this reflection will focus primarily on what we could have done better, as well as use hindsight to describe what we will “start” or “continue” doing.

## Procedural things:

### Start

* Updating Trello cards more frequently
* Deleting unnecessary branches
* Reviewing pull requests faster

### Stop

* Committing temp files, files that only change build paths, etc.

### Continue

* Using GitHub for version control and code review
* Using Trello to keep track of who is doing which tasks and what still needs to be done
* Using Discord to communicate
* Having weekly/semi-weekly meetings
* Making frequent pull requests to make master up to date

## Code things:

### Start/More

* Simplifying overcomplicated code

## Stop/Avoid

* Using magic numbers
* Tight coupling
